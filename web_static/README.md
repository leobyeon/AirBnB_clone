## Description

This is a repository for the first segment of the AirBnB clone we will be creating for the next four months.
This project will consist of six parts:
* The console
* Web static
* MySQL storage
* Web framework - templating
* RESTful API
* Web Dynamic

This repo contains the first part: the console. The console is the storage system that will hold all the future objects that we will implement in the later parts of the project.
